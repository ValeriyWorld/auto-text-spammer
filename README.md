# auto-text-spammer

for PyAutoGUI install:
pip install pyautogui

ATTENTION!
1. After starting the program click in chat, text editor etc. because the program will try to type a text 'executing symbols' otherwise it can cause keyboard hotkeys and problems.
2. Text spamming stops only if program completed the task (you can choose the number of iterations of your text) OR if you activate console and press 'Ctrl + C' - it will cause      KeyboardInterrupt.
